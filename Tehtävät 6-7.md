# Paragraphs

# 1

We pictured the meek mild creatures where  
They dwelt in their strawy pen,  
Nor did it occur to one of us there  
To doubt they were kneeling then.

1. Crack three eggs over a bowl.  
Now, you're going to want to crack the eggs in such a way that you don't make a mess.  
If you _do_ make a mess, use a towel to clean it up!  

2. Pour a gallon of milk into the bowl.   
Basically, take the same guidance as above: don't be messy, but if you are, clean it up!
